            <p>I'm in my final year of Web Development at NTNU Gj√∏vik, where I've enjoyed exploring different technologies. My studies have focused on JavaScript, working with React on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend. I've also gained experience with databases, deployment, and CI/CD practices. I'm always eager to learn something new and grow as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>Through my studies, I've been project leader for group assignments, where I have coordinated our team's workflow and timelines while also contributing to the development.
            Outside of coding, I love spending time with friends and being outdoors. I also enjoy working with my hands through painting, crochet, and clay, which gives me a nice balance to screen time.</p>
